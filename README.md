#Introduction
Seiko watches are known for their value, especially their entry-level models like Seiko 5, SKX, SRP, and others. However, if you're interested in upgrading your watch's parts or creating an entirely customized watch for yourself, this guide can help point you in the right direction.

##Common Models for Modding
The easiest models to start modding with are the Seiko 5 series and SKX007 / SKX009 because there are large varieties of custom parts available that fit these models. SKX013 watches are also possible to mod, but the selection of parts for this model is quite limited given chapter ring and case size limitations.

#Straps / Bracelets
Straps are the banded materials that holds the watch case to your wrist. Materials can be made out of nylon (NATO), leather, metal bracelets (often stainless steel), and rubber.

#Bezels
Bezels are the circular edge of the watch that allows you to rotate the markers to indicate the passage of time. The mods involved change the design, texture, and finish of the bezel, not limited to three types:

* Coin edge: vertical lines on a circlar edge, similar to a coin
* Marathon: protruding blocky teeth
* Pilot / Non-insert: removes bezel function
* Submariner / Sub: protruding sharp teeth

#Bezel Inserts
Bezel inserts are the rotatable markers resting on the inner diameter of the bezel and have tool functions, such as minute timing or GMT hourly differences. There are three different materials and can be lumed:

* Aluminium: cheapest material and also the least durable (susceptible to scratches and dents). Seiko OEM bezel inserts are aluminium.
* Ceramic (lumeable): very resistant to scratches and dents and lume is more legible than sapphire.
* Sapphire (lumeable): like ceramic in that it is durable, but often is more glossier and the lume is not as legible.

**Dials**
The circular part of the watch that contains the branding, relevant watch specs, hour markers, and sometimes minute markings too. Please keep in mind that the dials must be compatible with movements. For example, you cannot mix a 7S26 / NH35 / NH36 dial with a 6R15 / NE15 movement.

#Crystals
Crystals are the glass that protects the front of your watch from the environment. Seiko OEM watches come with a mineral glass crystal called Hardlex, which is more durable than mineral glass from average brands. There are also sapphire crystals, which make the watch more resistant to scratches but is more susceptible to shattering than Hardlex.

**Different Shapes**
There are two types of sapphire crystals: flat, single dome, and double-dome.

**Casebacks**
Casebacks is the back of the watch that protects the movement from the environment. For example, the SKX watches will have the famous Kanagawa wave on the back of the watch.

#Movements
Seiko 5 and the SKX lines come with a 7S26 movement (day and date complication). While these movements are workhorses, they also lack two key features modern watches have: hacking and hand-winding. 

**SARB059 Crown**
If you want to upgrade the movement, you have a few choices and you MUST also upgrade your crown to one similar to the SARB059 that will allow you to adjust the movement:

* **SeikoParts:** https://seikoparts.wordpress.com/2018/06/28/introducing-the-s-crown-a-sarb059-alternative/

**Movements**
* NH35 (Day-only complication): http://www.startimesupply.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=NH35&Store_Code=1&search=nh35&offset=&filter_cat=&PowerSearch_Begin_Only=
* NH36A (Day and Date complication): http://www.startimesupply.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=NH36&Store_Code=1&search=nh36&offset=&filter_cat=&PowerSearch_Begin_Only=
* NE15 (6R15 equivalent, Day-only complication): http://www.startimesupply.com/product/NE15.html

Keep in mind that the upgraded movement dictates the compatability with the dial and vice versa (i.e., a 6R15 dial must match the NE15 / 6R15 movement).

#Day and Date Wheels
You also have the option of changing out the day and date wheels based on colour and languages. Colours are only in white or black. Day wheels have the option of English and either Chinese, Japanese, Roman, or Spanish. You can also swap out the day wheel on your Seiko OEM watch with the new movement's provided they are equivalent (7S26 = NH35 = NH36) for those who want to keep their Arabic, French, etc. day wheels.

You can find these on eBay.
